// Functions (in JS functions are objects. Callable objects)
// JS has First-class functions support (from MDN...) 
// A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions 
// in that language are treated like any other variable. For example, in such a 
// language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be 
// returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable.

// function declaration
// function declaration MDN article: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function
function runMeRightAway() { console.log(`Welcome to JS from a function declaration`) }

// This returns a reference to a the runMeRightAway function
runMeRightAway

// add () to invoke the function
runMeRightAway()

var fnToRunLater = function () { console.log(`Welcome to JS from a function expression`) }
// function expression assigned to the fnToRunLater var variable (it will be a global variable)
// function expression MDN article: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function
// fnToRunLater is a global variable
// fnToRunLater points to a function expressions
// with an inferred name of `fnToRunLater`
// fnToRunLater() to invoke the function

// Objects
// Simple key-value pairs (think hashes in Ruby). The keys are strings (or Symbols), 
// and the values are any data type, including other objects.
