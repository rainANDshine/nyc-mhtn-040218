Areas for Review
================

- closures, scope
- practicing lifting State
  - extrapolating and refactoring (determining where state lives, really)
- what and where to import and export
- when debugger just doesn't work
- setting props within components (defaulting, passing)
- nested state and making new objects
- practice building from scratch
  - understanding other's code
  - vs
  - deciding yourself
