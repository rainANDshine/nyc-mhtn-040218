# Scope and closures

Code associated to the `Scope and closures` lecture

## Objectives

1.  Define scope resolution (buckets and marbles)
1.  Lexical scope
1.  JS scopes: global, functions and blocks (`{}` as a function body, block and object literal)
1.  `var` variable overview
1.  `let` overview
1.  `cost` overview
1.  Comparing 'hoisting' for `var` vs `let`/`const`
1.  Review how a a function can return a value
1.  Functions that return functions
1.  Closures and the outcome of first class functions plus Lexical scope
1.  Debugger and closures

> **First class functions**: A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that language are treated like any other variable. For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable. From `https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First-class_Function

> **Lexical scope**: Lexical scope means that scope is defined by author-time decisions of where functions are declared. From https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS

> **Closure**: A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. From https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures
