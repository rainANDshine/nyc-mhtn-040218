Deeper Dive into Babel in next week's lecture?
- We can do this. I'll adjust the lecture to talk more about the magic of Babel.
- For now, you just need to know that Babel is a compiler/transpiler.
- It takes JavaScript (often with newer or optional syntax like JSX) and converts it into JavaScript (but using older syntax only so it's better supported in most browsers).
